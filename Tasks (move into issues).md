1. Perform a basic thermal analysis to find the minimum wall thickness for a given power to provide a max chamber temperature
2. Calculate the length of coil required and mounting designs that work for this arrangement and power supply
3.1 Model the furnace chamber
3.2 begin electronics design (PSU, controller)
4. purchase components and tweak chamber design to fit
5. purchase and test electronics, refine
6. write controller code
7. design tooling for manufacturing furnace
8. meet up in garage and start manufacturing components
