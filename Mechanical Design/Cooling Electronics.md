We need to thermally isolate the control board and PSU from the rest of the lower frame chamber, without significantly increasing the convective heat transfer rate of the chamber base. This calls for a ducted cooling system over the control board and PSU.

## Method of Control

There are three viable options for controlling the cooling fan:
- PID with PWM
- bang-bang with temperature limits
- always on (with some manual control and indicator)
