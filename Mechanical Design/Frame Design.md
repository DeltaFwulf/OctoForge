# Objective
create a strong and portable frame that houses all furnace components and provides suitable environmental conditions for all subsystems

## Key Features
- Portability: the furnace should be carriable by a single person up to chest height.
- Durability: the furnace should have no exposed insulation on the outer surfaces - should be able to take a light kick or bump against a rough, hard surface.
- Ease of maintenance / assembly: the furnace should be made of modules that can be disassembled and maintained easily and cheaply. Unique fastener types should be minimised. 


The furnace structure consists of two main sections: the chamber and the lower frame.

The chamber houses the heating elements, sensors and insulation, while the lower frame houses the control electronics, power supply, and tool storage.
