The furnace is composed of two main mechanical subassemblies, the chamber and the frame. The frame forms the furnaces structure, housing the chamber as well as the electronics.


[ IMAGE OF FRAME ]


To simplify manufacture and make the frame as cheap as possible, parts are to be made largely from sheet metal, allowing for quick and low-cost laser cut / bend services to be used. Where this is not possible, simple machining operations that can be performed on a mill / lathe must be chosen, such that these parts can be produced by hand.


## General Concept

- panels and bulkheads hold together, allowing ease of modification
- eight panels to approximate cylindrical shape while still using easy to cut angles

**General Requirements**
- The furnace must be able to be carried by two people via handles
- The furnace must be able to be moved while in operation (cool touchpoints)
- The furnace must survive a car journey when not in operation
- The furnace should survive tipping over unless containing molten metal
- The frame must not slip easily, and be able to prevent rocking by adjustable feet
- The frame must be easy to disassemble into individual components via fastener joints, for maintenance or upgrade purposes


## Bill of Materials
Parts have sorted into three categories: machined components, that must be produced from some stock, fasteners (such as bolts, nuts, washers), and off-the shelf components, such as handles, feet, etc.
