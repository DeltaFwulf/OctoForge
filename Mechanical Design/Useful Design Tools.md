## Product Design Specification

This document outlines the requirements that the design must fulfil, as well as how these requirements were chosen and their priority. This is a very useful tool for constraining the design early on, reducing feature creep and confusion as to where to begin.

## Morphological Charts

This is a graphical method for choosing how to solve different requirements in the PDS. We create a table where the y-axis is requirements and the x-axis consists of concepts of how to solve each requirement. A path is chosen through the table by evaluating the pros and cons of each sub-design concept, allowing a rough image of the overall system to form quickly. Changes can of course be made later on, but this is quite an efficient way to think outside of the one or two examples you thought of on the spot before starting, when a better third option may exist. (brainstorming really helps here)

## Product Breakdown System

This is a super useful way to organise large assemblies. Every component, assembly, and subassembly is assigned a number. This allows easy organisation of parts in spreadsheets containing specific data and CAD structuring through subassemblies. There's a lot more that can be done, such as quantifying progress within a project by assigning weights to not only parts but tasks, and their corresponding progresses.

A good explanation was actually done on Wintergatan's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVyEsMiwvVc)
