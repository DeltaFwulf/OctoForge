To begin i put together a schematic based on the peripheral schematic found in the [ESP32-S3-WROOM-2 Datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-wroom-2_datasheet_en.pdf).

Next was to add the various addition peripherals and sensors. Namely, the thermocouples. For this i followed schematic 1 layout in [A Basic Guide to Thermocouple Measurements](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sbaa274a/sbaa274a.pdf?ts=1705904504774&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fduckduckgo.com%252F#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A57%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2Cnull%2C739.5%2Cnull%5D). With AIN0 and AIN1 feeding into an [instrumentation amplifier](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_5.html) to amplify the small voltage difference produced by the thermocouple. 
This layout of thermocouple has built in burn out detection as a burn out would cause the voltage between AIN0 and AIN1 to jump to the voltage across the voltage divider.
To measure the temperature at the tip of a thermocouple both metal wires at the other end must be at an equal and known temperature. The equal part is ensured by the isothermal cold junction block. The known part can be measured with the use of an additional thermistor measuring the temperature at or near the cold junction block. This temperate must be converted to a voltage, then added to the voltage across the thermocouple before that voltage can be converted into a temperature. [Conversion tables can be found here](http://srdata.nist.gov/its90/menu/menu.html).
A rotary encoded can be wired up by pulling terminals A, B, and the push button high and terminal C low. A, B, and the push button can then trigger whatever function on the microcontroller on a low.
