## Objectives
To create a simple heat-transfer model of the furnace chamber to permit minimum chamber wall thickness, wire sizing, and maximum wire size to be estimated.
## Sub-tasks
- model the furnace walls as a resistance network
- estimate heat loss against several furnace parameters
	- poll different brick types (balance cost)
	- vary different wall thicknesses
	- attempt to identify a smallest 'good enough' furnace
	- plot performance of a seemingly good furnace against environmental conditions
- model the wire using a resistance network (simplified radiation + convection in air with an efficiency factor) to calculate wire temperature vs power, chamber temperature
