# Objective: 
minimise power while optimising insulation requirements

## Sub-tasks
- Calculate heat loss per unit area of furnace walls (cylindrical)
- poll different brick types (balance cost)
- assume coils and inner chamber are at same temperature
- calculate wire temperature for given chamber temperature and power output
